```js
const toChunks = (array, size) => {
  return array.reduce((arr, item, idx) => {
  return idx % size === 0
    ? [...arr, [item]]
    : [...arr.slice(0, -1), [...arr.slice(-1)[0], item]];
  }, []);
};
```

## Context

As a JavaScript developer, you may need to split an array into smaller arrays of a specific size and while you may be used to the **_.chunk(data, size)** function from Lodash you can also do it rather easily using only native Javascript. The **toChunks** function here is the perfect snippet for this task. Let's first find out how it to use it :

## Usage

```js
toChunks([1, 2, 3, 4], 1) // [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
toChunks([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) // [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
toChunks([1, 2, 3, 4], 3) // [[1, 2, 3], [4]]
toChunks([1, 2, 3, 4], 4) // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Demystify the "toChunks" Function

We can divide the **toChunks** function into three main parts:
1. **The toChunks function:** that takes two arguments **array** and **size**, as the size of each desired **chunk**.
2. **Reduce:** The provided array is iterated over by the [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) method which takes two arguments: a callback function and an initial value for the **accumulator**, here an empty array [].
3. **The callback function:** which is executed for every item taking three arguments: the **accumulator** (arr), the current **item** in the array, and his **index** (idx).

## How it works

To provide a more concrete example i will base the explanation on this example :

```js
toChunks([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) // [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
1. First, the callback function running on each item will check **if the current index is divisible by the size argument (2)** using the remainder operator [%](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder).
2. If it does, then we will create a new chunk with the current item before adding it to the **accumulator** using the spread operator [...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), in case of our example, after one iteration the **accumulator** would look like that [[1]]. 
3. Otherwise, it means that we need to **add the current item to the last chunk in the accumulator**. To do so, the [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) method is used to extract the last element of the accumulator (which after the first iteration is still `[1]`) before adding the current item with the mighty spread operator "[...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)" so that after the second iteration we have `[1, 2]`. Then, we replace the last element of the accumulator with the updated chunk again using the [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) method so that we end up with this value [[1, 2]].
4. After every iteration placing each item inside the right chunk, the [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) method returns the accumulator, so that we end up with an array of smaller arrays with the values of the original array.

And tada ðŸŽ‰ 
```js
toChunks([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) // [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

## Conclusion

The toChunks function is the perfect snippet for splitting an array into smaller arrays of a specific size. By properly using the powers of [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce), [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) and the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), we can easily create such a function only using native JavaScript instead of **Lodash**.
