```js
function pull(arr, removeList) {
  var removeSet = new Set(removeList);
  return arr.filter(function (el) {
    return !removeSet.has(el);
  });
}
```

## Context

As a seasoned JavaScript developer, there are situations where you need to remove specific elements from an array based on a list. Let's say, in an ecommerce site there is a list of items that a user wants to remove from their shopping cart or in case of a to-do list, items that the user wants to mark as completed. Well we can do both rather easily, let's find out how:

## Usage

The **pull()** function provided in the above code is designed to remove specific elements from an array in a highly efficient manner. It takes two arguments: **arr**, which is the original array, and **removeList**, which is an array of elements to be removed from **arr**.

To speed up the process of removing elements from **arr**, the **pull()** function creates a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) called **removeSet** that stores the elements to be removed. The [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) object is used instead of an array to improve the efficiency thanks to the built-in [has()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/has) method which as a constant time complexity not matter how big the [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) gets. Otherwise, we would have to use [find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) thus another loop, thus a loop inside a loop...

Finally, the [filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method is then used to create a new array that includes only the elements that are not present in **removeSet**.

```js
// Primitives
pull([1, 2, 3, 3, 3], [1]); // [2, 3, 3, 3]
pull([1, 2, 3, 3, 3], [1, 3]); // [2]
```

Note: To follow up on the example we could extend this function to handle objects aswell in order to remove our unwanted elements from the user's shopping card simply like this:

```js
function pull(arr, removeList) {
  var removeSet = new Set(removeList.map((obj) => obj.id));
  return arr.filter(function (el) {
    return !removeSet.has(el.id);
  });
}

const shoppingCard = [
  { id: 1, name: "Nike Air Max 1 OG" },
  { id: 2, name: "Air Jordan 1 Mid" },
];

const removeList = [{ id: 2, name: "Air Jordan 1 Mid" }];
pull(shoppingCard, removeList);
// [
//  { id: 1, name: "Nike Air Max 1 OG" },
// ]

// Sorry for the Air Jordan fans though ðŸ˜Ž
```

Here, we simply iniliaze our set with the values we want to look for, in our case the product ids (but we could provide the key as variable when necessary), sorry for the Air Jordan fans though.

::note
**Note that:** we could add a third parameter to have a variable key instead of our fixed mapping over ids.

## Conclusion

The **pull** function efficiently removes specific elements from an array using a Set. This approach ensures fast removal without nested loops, enhancing performance and simplicity in your code. Happy coding!
