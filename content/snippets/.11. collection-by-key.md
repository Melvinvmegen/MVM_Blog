```javascript
function keyBy(array, key) {
  return array.reduce(
    (accumulator, currentValue) => ({
      ...accumulator,
      [key ? currentValue[key] : currentValue]: currentValue,
    }),
    {}
  );
}
// For our one liner friends
const keyBy = (array, key) => (array || []).reduce((r, x) => ({ ...r, [key ? x[key] : x]: x }), {});

function collectionKeyBy(collection = {}, key) {
  return Array.isArray(c) ? keyBy(c, key) : keyBy(Object.values(c), key);
}
```

## Introduction
The **keyBy** function is a handy snippet for convert an array of object into an object of object by the provided key. This can be useful in situations where you need to quickly organize data in an object by a specific property. For example, suppose you have an array of objects representing books, and you want to quickly create an object where the keys are the book titles and the values are the corresponding book objects. You can use the **keyBy** function to achieve this in a single line of code !

## Description
The **keyBy** function takes two arguments, an array and an optional key parameter. The [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) method is used to iterate over each element of the provided array, creating a new object with the value of the key given in parameter or the value itself if the key parameter is not provided **which could be interesting for primitives value but to be avoided for object at the result would simply wrap the last provided value of the provided array into an object**.
Back to our books example:

```javascript
// Primitives values
let books = ['The Great Gatsby', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Pride and Prejudice']
let booksByKey = keyBy(books);
// {
//    "The Great Gatsby": "The Great Gatsby",
//    "To Kill a Mockingbird": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
//    "Pride and Prejudice": "Pride and Prejudice"
// }
books = [
{ title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', year: 1925 },
{ title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird', author: 'Harper Lee', year: 1960 },
{ title: 'Pride and Prejudice', author: 'Jane Austen', year: 1813 }
];

// Object values
booksByKey = keyBy(books, 'title');
console.log(booksByKey);
// {
// 'The Great Gatsby': { title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', year: 1925 },
// 'To Kill a Mockingbird': { title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird', author: 'Harper Lee', year: 1960 },
// 'Pride and Prejudice': { title: 'Pride and Prejudice', author: 'Jane Austen', year: 1813 }
// }
booksByKey['The Great Gatsby'].author // "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
```

The **collectionKeyBy** function is a modified version of keyBy that can handle both arrays and objects as its first argument. It first checks if the collection is an **array** using the [isArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray) method. If it is an array, it calls the keyBy function directly. If it is an object, it uses Object.values to get an array of the object's values and then calls the keyBy function. This code be usefull if you wanna unwrap objects that are keyed randomly by an API , let say you get registrations from an endpoint:

```javascript
const registrations = {registration1: {id: 1, name: "Fred"}, registration2: {id: 2, name: "Hugue"}, registration3: {id: 3, name: "Paul"}}
console.log(collectionKeyBy(registrations, "id"))
{
  "1": {"id": 1, "name": "Fred"},
  "2": {"id": 2,"name": "Hugue"},
  "3": {"id": 3,"name": "Paul"}
}
```

## Conclusion:
The keyBy and **collectionKeyBy** functions are useful utility functions that can be used to generate an object from an array or an object of values litteraly keyed by the seconde parameter **key**. This implementation of **collectionKeyBy** can handle both arrays and objects as input, and the optional **key** parameter allows for flexibility in handling primitives or reference data types in generating the new object's keys.
