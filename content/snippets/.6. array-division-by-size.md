```js
const toChunks = (array, size) => {
  return array.reduce((arr, item, idx) => {
  return idx % size === 0
    ? [...arr, [item]] 
    : [...arr.slice(0, -1), [...arr.slice(-1)[0], item]];
  }, []);
};

```

## Context

As a JavaScript developer, you may need to split an array into smaller arrays of a specific length and while you may be used to using the **_.chunk(data, size)** function from Lodash you can also do it rather easily using native Javascript. The **toChunks** function here is the perfect snippet for this task. Let's find out how it works :

## Demystify the "toChunks" Function

We can divide the **toChunks** function into three parts:
- The toChunks function takes two arguments: **array** and **size** which as there name suggests takes an array and the size of each desired **chunk** (or array).
- The provided array is iterated over by the [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) method which takes two arguments: a callback function and an initial value for the **accumulator**, here an empty array [].
- The callback function takes three arguments: the **accumulator** (arr), the current **item** in the array (item), and his **index** (idx).

## How it actually works

1. The callback function running on each item will check **if the current index is divisible by the size argument** using the remainder operator [%](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder).
2. 
  - If it does, then we will create a new chunk or array with the current item before adding it to the **accumulator** using the spread operator [...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).
  - Otherwise, it means that we need to **add the current item to the last chunk in the accumulator**. To do this, the [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) method is used to extract the last element of the accumulator (which in our case is a chunk or array) before adding the current item to it with the mighty spread operator [...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax). Then, we replace the last element of the accumulator with the updated chunk again using the [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) method.
3. Finally, the [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) method returns the accumulator, which is now an array of smaller arrays with the values of the original array.

And tada ðŸŽ‰ 
```js
toChunks([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) // [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

## Conclusion

The toChunks function is the perfect snippet for splitting an array into smaller arrays of a specific length. By properly using the powers of [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce), [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) and the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), we can easily create such a function only using native JavaScript instead of **Lodash**.
