Usually when you want to assign a value from an object to a new variable you go line by line and use the dot notation for every new variable you want to assign but how about using the new ES6 features, [destructuring assignement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

**Bonus**: you don't have to use the key name for your new variable you can just assign it a new name like this : **const { a: a1, b: b1 } = obj**. I know this might look troubling at first and even decrease readability for newcomers but you get used to it 😊

```js
const user = { 
  firstname: "John",
  lastname: "Doe"
  age: 28
}
// ❌ Avoid this
const firstname = user.firstname
const lastname = user.lastname
const age = user.age

// ✅ Do this
const {firstname, lastname, age} = user
```

Callback
In JavaScript, you can also pass a function as an argument to a function. This function that is passed as an argument inside of another function is called a callback function. For example: you have user firstname and lastname and you need to get full data of user using full name

let getUserFullName = (firstName, lastName, callback) => {
    let fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`);
    callback(fullName);
}
getUserFullName(“Jhon”, “Don”, getUserDetailByName);
getUserDetailByName = (userName) =>{
 // Write your code here
}

## Solve existence testing with includes

Testing the existence of a value within an array is a common problem. Thankfully, JavaScript comes with a special array method, includes(), which will return a Boolean if the array contains the searched value. Rather than searching the array, this method provides an efficient, easy-to-read solution.

```js
const categories = ['javascript', 'vue', 'node'];

categories.includes('javascript') // true
```

## Shorten conditionals with falsy values
In JavaScript, there are many values that are equivalent to false across multiple types of variables. This includes:

- the Boolean false
- null
- 0
- NaN (not a number)
- ''
- ""

```js
const user = {
  firstname: "John", 
  lastname: "Doe", 
  admin: false
}

if (!user.admin) {
  console.log('User not authorized')
} // 'User not authorized'

// Longhand
if (value = true) { … }

// Shorthand
if (value) { … }
```

Sometimes, however, shorthands might return surprising results. So, always be sure of what you’re doing, check the documentation, find relevant JavaScript code examples, and test the outcome.

## Create helper functions for common tasks
The topic of modularization comes up frequently in discussions of JavaScript best practices. Modularization means the splitting of larger files into smaller parts — a.k.a. reusable modules. ECMAScript modules and module bundlers such as Webpack help with setting up such architecture, but creating modular and reusable functions is just as important.

As the first SOLID design principle (single responsibility principle) states, every function, interface, class, and other code structure should perform only one task. Creating helper functions for common tasks is one way to follow this principle. Helper functions should be context-independent so that they can be called from any module.

```js
function pick (obj, props) {

	// Create new object
	var picked = {};

	// Loop through props and push to new object
	for (let prop of props) {
		picked[prop] = obj[prop];
	}

	// Return new object
	return picked;
```

## Write shorter loops with array methods
For our final tip, we’ll dive into the complexity of array optimization. Loops are a common way to create and populate arrays. However, they cause a lot of clutter and can be hard to read due to the number of lines required.

Instead, you can use array methods to accomplish similar effects as for loops with only a fraction of the lines. Take this for loop for example.

const prices = ['1.0', 'negotiable', '2.15'];
 
const formattedPrices = [];
for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    const price = parseFloat(prices[i]);
    if (price) {
        formattedPrices.push(price);
    }
}
console.log(formattedPrices);
Instead of the above code, we can get the same effect from three lines below by making use of the map method. This method creates an equivalently sized array with only the prices property. We then get float values of that price using the parseFloat.

const prices = ['1.0', '2.15'];
const formattedPrices = prices.map(price => parseFloat(price));
console.log(formattedPrices)

## 14. Use for...of instead of for loops
Loops can lead to performance issues because you repeat the same operation over and over again. However, if you optimize them, you can make them run faster.

There are many JavaScript best practices to write more performant loops, such as avoiding nesting, keeping DOM manipulation outside of loops, and declaring a separate variable for the length of the loop *(e.g. let cityCount = cities.length)*.

Using the for...of statement instead of for is such a JavaScript coding practice, too. This syntax has been introduced by ECMAScript 6, and it includes a built-in iterator so that you don’t have to define the i variable and the length value:

```js
// with for loop
let users = ["John Doe", "Mark Hunt", "Cyril Gane", "Conor McGregor"];

// This avoids length behind reavaluated at every iteration
let usersCount = users.length;
for (let i = 0; i < usersCount; i++) {
	console.log(users[i]);
}

// with for...of loop
for(user of users) {
	console.log(users);
}
```

Notice how much more readable it is! And you don't have to care about all this (let i = 0; i < usersCount; i++) clumsy logic though you might need it for some specific use case, like an irregular interval.
