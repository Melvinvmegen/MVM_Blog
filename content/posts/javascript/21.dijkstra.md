## Dijkstra's Algorithm: The Shortest Path Finder

## Edsger W. Dijkstra

Before diving into the algorithm, let's honor its creator: **Edsger W. Dijkstra** (1930-2002), a Dutch computer scientist and one of the pioneers of programming as a discipline. His contributions include:
- The **Dijkstra's algorithm** (1956) for shortest paths
- The **banker's algorithm** for deadlock avoidance
- Seminal work on structured programming
- The **Goto Statement Considered Harmful** paper (1968)

Dijkstra's work laid foundations for modern computer science, particularly in algorithm design and programming methodology.

## Theory

### Key Differences from Unweighted Graphs

To understand this algorithm we first need to understand weighted graphs, I won't go into much details about graphs themselves since I did a blog post which you can find [here](https://blog.melvinvmegen.com/posts/javascript/graph). What I will do is highlight the major difference between them.

| Feature             | Unweighted Graph           | Weighted Graph                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Representation      | Array of connected nodes   | Array of objects with `node` and `weight` properties |
| Path Calculation    | Counts hops/edges          | Sums weights                                         |
| Example Use Case    | Social network connections | GPS navigation routes                                |

**Why weights matter**: In real-world scenarios, connections often have a weight (distance, time, money). A weighted graph models these relationships more accurately.

## Implementation

### Core Concepts
1. **Priority Queue:** Processes nodes based on a weight, smallest or greatest
2. **Greedy Approach:** Always extends the shortest known path first
3. **Relaxation:** Updates shorter paths as they're discovered

### Visual Example

Consider this graph:

A --2--> B
|        |
1        | 3
|        |
C --4--> D

The shortest path from A to D is A→B→D (total weight = 5)

### Hands on

```javascript
class PriorityQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.values = [];
  }
  enqueue(val, priority) {
    this.values.push({ val, priority });
    this.sort();
  }
  dequeue() {
    return this.values.shift();
  }
  sort() {
    this.values.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);
  }
}

class WeightedGraph {
  constructor() {
    this.adjacencyList = {};
  }

  addVertex(vertex) {
    if (!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) this.adjacencyList[vertex] = [];
  }

  addEdge(v1, v2, weight) {
    this.adjacencyList[v1].push({ node: v2, weight });
    this.adjacencyList[v2].push({ node: v1, weight }); // For undirected graph
  }

  Dijkstra(start, finish) {
    const nodes = new PriorityQueue();
    const distances = {};
    const previous = {};
    let path = [];
    let smallest;

    // Initialize distances and priority queue
    for (let vertex in this.adjacencyList) {
      if (vertex === start) {
        distances[vertex] = 0;
        nodes.enqueue(vertex, 0);
      } else {
        distances[vertex] = Infinity;
        nodes.enqueue(vertex, Infinity);
      }
      previous[vertex] = null;
    }

    while (nodes.values.length) {
      smallest = nodes.dequeue().val;

      if (smallest === finish) {
        // Reconstruct path
        while (previous[smallest]) {
          path.push(smallest);
          smallest = previous[smallest];
        }
        break;
      }

      if (smallest && distances[smallest] !== Infinity) {
        for (let neighbor of this.adjacencyList[smallest]) {
          // Calculate new distance
          let candidate = distances[smallest] + neighbor.weight;
          if (candidate < distances[neighbor.node]) {
            distances[neighbor.node] = candidate;
            previous[neighbor.node] = smallest;
            nodes.enqueue(neighbor.node, candidate);
          }
        }
      }
    }
    return path.concat(smallest).reverse();
  }
}

// Usage Example:
const graph = new WeightedGraph();
graph.addVertex("A");
graph.addVertex("B");
graph.addVertex("C");
graph.addVertex("D");
graph.addEdge("A", "B", 1);
graph.addEdge("A", "C", 1);
graph.addEdge("B", "D", 3);
graph.addEdge("C", "D", 4);

console.log(graph.Dijkstra("A", "D")); // Output: ["A", "B", "D"]
```

**Explanation:**
1. Initialize all distances to `Infinity` except the start node (distance = 0)
2. Use a [priority queue](https://blog.melvinvmegen.com/posts/javascript/queue) to process nodes by current shortest distance
3. For each node, examine all neighbors and update their distances if a shorter path is found
4. Track the path using a `previous` object
5. Terminate when the destination node is reached or all nodes are processed

## Edge Cases and Limitations
1. **Negative Weights:**  Dijkstra's fails (use [Bellman-Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm) instead)
2. **Disconnected Nodes:** Returns empty path if no route exists
3. **Tie Breakers:** When multiple paths have same weight, returns first found

## Practical Use Cases
Dijkstra algorithm is useful in various real-world applications:
- **GPS Navigation:** Finds fastest routes between locations.
- **Network Routing:** Determines optimal data paths.
- **Airline Scheduling:** Calculates most efficient flight connections.
- **Game AI:** Pathfinding for NPCs.
- **Circuit Design:** Optimizes wire routing.

## Performance Considerations

### **Time Complexity**:
With V being the number of vertices and E the number of edges.
- **Naive (array-based):** O(V²) **mostly suitable for dense graphs**
- **Binary Heap:** O((V+E) log V) **most common implementation**
- **Fibonacci Heap:** O(E + V log V) **Theoretical best, complex implementation**

### **Space Complexity**:
- **O(V)** for storing distances and previous nodes.
- **O(V)** for the priority queue.

## Conclusion
